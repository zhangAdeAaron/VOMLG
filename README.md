# VOMLG
A multi-scale time-frequency fusion architecture (VOMLG): Current deep learning models cannot capture transient dynamics and periodic patterns within high-dimensional industrial signals due to single-domain analysis constraints. We propose the VOMLG framework that synergistically integrates wavelet transform and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to address this. The architecture employs multi-scale signal reconstruction to preserve time-localized features while establishing dual-domain representation learning through combined wavelet coefficients and FFT spectra. By hierarchically fusing features across varying time-frequency resolutions, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches that analyse temporal and spectral characteristics in isolation. This integrated design enables the simultaneous extraction of localised transients and global periodic signatures critical for industrial diagnostics.
